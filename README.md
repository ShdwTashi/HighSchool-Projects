I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my teacher and best friends for their support, encouragement, and inspiration. Their unwavering belief in me and their constant encouragement have shaped me into the person I am today â€“ someone who is passionate about coding and aspires to pursue a career in hacking. I am forever grateful for their friendship, guidance, and belief in my potential.
