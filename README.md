## Introduction
In high school, I got to dive into different projects that introduced me to Java programming. These experiences weren't just about learning syntax; they showed me how Java works in real-world scenarios. As I tinkered with code, I realized how creative and impactful coding can be. It's amazing to think about the endless possibilities technology holds for the future. These moments sparked my love for coding and gave me a glimpse of the exciting journey ahead.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my teacher and best friends for their support, encouragement, and inspiration. Their unwavering belief in me and their constant encouragement have shaped me into the person I am today â€“ someone who is passionate about coding and aspires to pursue a career in hacking. I am forever grateful for their friendship, guidance, and belief in my potential.
